"The Reverend Author of this Compendious Summary was"
alias
"a Pious and Religeous person, (as appears by his
zealous Transports in this Narrative for promotion of the Christian
Faith) elevated from a Frier of the"
"Order to sit in the
Episcopal Chair, who was frequently importuned by Good and Learned Men,
particularly Historians, to Publish this Summary, who so prevailed with
him, that he Collected out of that copious History which might and
ought to be written on this subject, the contents of this concise
Treatise with intention to display unto the World the Enormities,"
the
"committed in"
"during their residence there, to
their eternal ignominy; and for the author finding that no Admonitions
or Reprehensions, how mild soever could operate upon or sink into the
rocky-hearted Tyrants in those Occidental parts; he therefore took up a
firm resolution, being then about 50 years of age (as he himself
declares) to run the Hazards and Dangers by Sea, and the Risque of a
long voyage into"
"there to acquaint and Certifie the most
Illustrious Prince"
"the Son and Heir of his Imperial Majesty"
"the Fifth of Blessed Memory, with the Horrid crimes,"
"perpetrated in those countries, part whereof he had seen, and part
heard from such as boasted of their Wickedness. Whereupon his"
"Majesty moved with a tender and Christian compassion
towards these Inhabitants of the Countries of"
"languishing
for want of redress, he called a Council at"
"Anno Dom.
1542. consisting of Learned and Able Men,  in order to the reformation
of the"
"government, and took such a course, that from that
time their Tyranny and cruelty against those"
"was somewhat
repressed, and those Nations in some measure delivered from that
intolerable and more then"
"Bondage, or at least the"
"ill usage and treatment of the"
"was alleviated
and abated.  This Book mostly"
part
"was
Published first by the Author in"
at

Translated into"
"by himself; and in process of time into"
"and now"
"which is the Sixth
Language it has been taught to speak, that anyone of what Nation soever
might in this Narrative contemplate and see as in a mirror the dismal
and pernitious fruits, that lacquey and attend unlimited and close
fisted Avarice, and thereby Learn to abhor and detest it,"
"it being the predominant and chiefest motive to the comission
of such inexpressible Outrages, as here in part are faintly, not fully
represented.  Which sin the Pagan"
"themselves did exprobate in
the"
"with all Detestation, Ignominy and Disgrace: for when
they had taken some of them Prisoners (which was rarely) they bound
them hand and foot, laid them on the ground, and then pouring melted
Gold down their Throats, cried out and called to them aloud in
derision,"
"I will
then shut up all this, being but an Extract of what is in the Prefatory
part of the Original.  I earnestly beg and desire all Men to be
perswaded, that this summary was not published upon any private Design,
sinister ends or affection in favor or prejudice of any particular
Nation; but for the publick Emolument and Advantage of all true
Christians and moral Men throughout the whole World."

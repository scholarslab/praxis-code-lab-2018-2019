#Create a class for storing information about historical figures.
#Have the class store a first and last name. Have a method in the class to return the full name.
#Have the class store the person's relevant century BUT there's only a set series of options for centuries, which is the following:
#centuries = ['long 19th century', 'even longer 18th century', 'Medieval Times', '1999']
#Have the class store the set options for centuries, and then have a method to check before adding a century if the century exist in centuries and only add it to the class if it's an accepted value.
#Have the class store the person's expertises.
#Have a method that makes sure any expertise added to expertises doesn't already exist in expertises.
#Have a method to return the person's class information to a dictionary (hint checkout the classes resources for help!)
#Use your class to create three historical figures.
#Print out all three figures' information when you run the script.
#Write the historical figures' information to a text file using the python "io" library.
